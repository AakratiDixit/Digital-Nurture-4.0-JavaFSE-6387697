Time Complexity:
----------------
Each recursive call reduces years by 1.
So total recursive calls = n (number of years).
Hence, Time Complexity = O(n)


Space Complexity:
-----------------
Due to the recursive call stack: O(n)


Optimization:
-------------
Problem: Recursion can be inefficient for large n due to stack memory limits.
Solution: Convert to Iterative (Tail-Recursive or Loop)
Time Complexity = O(n)
Space Complexity = O(1) â†’ More efficient.
