What is Recursion?
------------------
Recursion is a programming technique where a method calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem. It usually involves:

1) A base case (to stop recursion).
2) A recursive case (where the method calls itself).


Why Use Recursion?
------------------
1) Simplifies problems like tree traversal, factorial, Fibonacci, etc.
2) Helps break down complex problems into simpler subproblems.
