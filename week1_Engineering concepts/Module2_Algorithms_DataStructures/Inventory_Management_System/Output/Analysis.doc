Time Complexity for diffirent operations using HashMap:
-------------------------------------------------------

Operation	 Time Complexity
-----------------------------
Add	         O(1)
Update	     O(1)
Delete	     O(1)
Display	     O(n)

Add, update, and delete all take O(1) time in a HashMap because of the direct key-based access.
Display all products is O(n) because we have to iterate over all products.


Optimizations:
--------------

1) Use a HashMap because of its constant time complexity.
2) For very large inventories, we can later optimize memory usage or add indexing if required.
3) For concurrent access (multi-threaded environment), we can use ConcurrentHashMap instead of   HashMap.
