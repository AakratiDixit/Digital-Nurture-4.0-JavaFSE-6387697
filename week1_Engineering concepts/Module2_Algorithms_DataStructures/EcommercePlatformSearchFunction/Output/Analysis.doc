Question1:
Compare the time complexity of linear and binary search algorithms.

Solution:

| Search Type   | Time Complexity | Explanation                            |
| ------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Linear Search | O(n)            | Checks each product one by one         |
| Binary Search | O(log n)        | Divides search space in half each time |


Question2:
Discuss which algorithm is more suitable for your platform and why?

Solution:
1) For small datasets, linear search is acceptable.
2) For large datasets, binary search is highly recommended because it is much faster.

Binary Search is more suitable for an e-commerce platform because:
1) Product catalogs can be huge.
2) Fast search experience is expected by users.
3) The list can be easily sorted to make binary search work.
